Me: 
I am working on an HIVScreening guideline based on CDC guidelines. Which working group would be appropriate for that domain?

ChatGPT:
For an HIV Screening guideline based on CDC guidelines, the appropriate HL7 Working Group would typically be the **Clinical Quality Information (CQI) Work Group**. The CQI Work Group focuses on standards for quality measurement and clinical decision support, which aligns well with the development of guidelines for HIV screening.

### Clinical Quality Information (CQI) Work Group

The CQI Work Group is responsible for:

- Developing and maintaining standards for quality measurement.
- Supporting the implementation and use of clinical decision support.
- Ensuring interoperability for quality measurement and clinical decision support.

### Steps to Engage with the CQI Work Group

1. **Join HL7 and the CQI Work Group:**
   - Ensure you have an HL7 membership. Joining the CQI Work Group can be done through the HL7 website.

2. **Attend Meetings:**
   - Participate in CQI Work Group meetings, which are held regularly. Meeting schedules and agendas are usually posted on the HL7 website and the CQI Work Group Confluence page.

3. **Collaborate and Contribute:**
   - Engage with other members of the CQI Work Group. Share your project details and seek input and collaboration opportunities.

4. **Initiate a Project Scope Statement (PSS):**
   - Work with the CQI Work Group to draft a Project Scope Statement (PSS) for your HIV Screening guideline project. This outlines the project’s goals, scope, and deliverables.

5. **Follow the Balloting Process:**
   - Once your project is approved, follow the HL7 balloting process to develop, test, and refine your guideline.

### Additional Work Groups to Consider

- **Public Health Work Group:** If your guideline also involves public health reporting or data exchange with public health entities, this work group could be relevant.
- **Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Work Group:** This work group focuses on standards and best practices for clinical decision support, which may also be relevant to your project.

### Resources

- [HL7 Public Health Work Group](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/pher/index.cfm)
- [HL7 Clinical Decision Support Work Group](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/dss/index.cfm)

Engaging with the CQI Work Group will provide you with the support and resources needed to develop and implement your HIV Screening guideline based on CDC guidelines.

The CDS workgroup is probably the one I would approach, since I intend for this HIVScreening tool to be applied in real time during patient care. Lets assume I got through all of these steps and got my IG approved. Might it then be possible to approach the CDC ( by way of maybe a CDC representative who happens to be an HL7 member or even better, a member of the clinical decision support work group) and suggest that the IG be adopted as a 'reference implementation' of the guideline?

ChatGPT:
Yes, it is entirely possible to approach the CDC to suggest that your approved Implementation Guide (IG) be adopted as a reference implementation of the guideline. Here’s a structured approach on how you might go about this:

### Steps to Approach the CDC

1. **Engage with CDC Representatives in HL7:**
   - Identify and connect with CDC representatives who are members of the HL7 Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Work Group or other relevant HL7 Work Groups.
   - Participate in HL7 meetings and forums where CDC representatives are present to build relationships and discuss your project.

2. **Present Your Approved IG:**
   - Prepare a detailed presentation of your IG, highlighting its alignment with CDC guidelines, its functionality, and its benefits for real-time application during patient care.
   - Demonstrate how the IG enhances clinical decision support and improves the implementation of HIV screening guidelines in practice.

3. **Request a Meeting or Presentation Slot:**
   - Formally request a meeting with CDC representatives or seek a slot to present your IG during a relevant HL7 Work Group meeting where CDC members are likely to attend.
   - Provide a summary of your IG and its significance in advance to generate interest.

4. **Highlight Evidence and Testing:**
   - Present evidence from any pilot implementations or testing (such as results from HL7 FHIR Connectathons) that demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of your IG.
   - Show how the IG complies with CDC guidelines and improves screening processes and outcomes.

5. **Propose Adoption as a Reference Implementation:**
   - Clearly propose that the CDC consider adopting your IG as a reference implementation for HIV screening guidelines.
   - Emphasize how this adoption could serve as a model for other healthcare organizations and improve standardization and quality of care.

6. **Follow Up and Collaborate:**
   - Follow up after your presentation to address any questions or concerns and to offer further information or demonstrations.
   - Be open to collaboration and feedback from the CDC to refine the IG if needed.

### Key Points to Emphasize

- **Alignment with CDC Guidelines:** Clearly show how your IG aligns with and supports the CDC’s HIV screening guidelines.
- **Real-time Clinical Decision Support:** Emphasize the IG’s capability to provide real-time decision support, improving patient care during clinical encounters.
- **Interoperability and Standardization:** Highlight how the IG promotes interoperability and standardization across different healthcare settings.
- **Proven Effectiveness:** Provide evidence from pilot tests or Connectathons to showcase the IG’s effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

### Potential Benefits for the CDC

- **Enhanced Screening Rates:** Improved implementation of HIV screening guidelines can lead to higher screening rates and earlier detection.
- **Consistency in Care:** Standardized implementation guides ensure consistent application of guidelines across various healthcare providers.
- **Improved Public Health Outcomes:** Better screening and early detection can contribute to improved public health outcomes and reduced transmission rates.

By following these steps and emphasizing the benefits of your IG, you can make a compelling case for the CDC to adopt your IG as a reference implementation. This approach not only strengthens the adoption of your IG but also enhances the overall quality and effectiveness of HIV screening practices.
