Never Tested Recommendation=HIV Screening Recommended due to patient never having been tested.
Never Tested Rationale=CDC recommends that diagnostic HIV testing and opt-out HIV screening be a part of routine clinical care in all health-care settings while also preserving the patients option to decline HIV testing and ensuring a provider-patient relationship conducive to optimal clinical and preventive care.

MSM Recommendation=HIV Screening Not Recommended at this time. It has been 172 days since last HIV Screening.
MSM Rationale=Among young (aged 18--24 years) men who have sex with men (MSM) surveyed during 2004--2005 in five U.S. cities, 14% were infected with HIV; 79% of these HIV-infected MSM were unaware of their infection.

Pregnant Recommendation=HIV Screening Recommended now due to patient being at first prenatal visit.
Pregnant Rationale=To promote informed and timely therapeutic decisions, health-care providers should test women for HIV as early as possible during each pregnancy. Women who decline the test early in prenatal care should be encouraged to be tested at a subsequent visit.
Pregnant Indicator=routine
Seeking STD Treatment Condition=false
Seeking STD Treatment Recommendation=HIV Screening Recommended now due to patient interest.
Seeking STD Treatment Rationale=All patients seeking treatment for STDs, including all patients attending STD clinics, should be screened routinely for HIV during each visit for a new complaint, regardless of whether the patient is known or suspected to have specific behavior risks for HIV infection.

Patient is at Moderate Risk for HIV=false
Risk Level Condition=false
Risk Level Recommendation=null
Patient is at No Risk for HIV=false
Risk Level Rationale=In low prevalence settings, in which the majority of clients are at minimal risk, targeted HIV testing on the basis of risk screening was considered more feasible for identifying limited numbers of HIV-infected persons. The Task Force concluded that such screening would detect additional patients with HIV, but the overall number would be limited, and the potential benefits did not clearly outweigh the burden on primary care practices or the potential harms of a general HIV screening program.
